# Tests for Jira using Python

Hey! My name is MÃ¡rk, and in this project I tested the most cruical features of Jira.
My test environment was set up in a certain way, so not all tests pass on my end (how it should be).
In this project I wanted to try python, and chose to go with POM and KDT as a design pattern.
I tried to write the code as clean as possible, but I'm always open for comments and improvements on it.

# Technologies Used

I used mostly Python (I was mostly experimenting with the seleniumbase package), I also tried out Behave to have a test in BDD.

# Feedback and Support

While this project is primarily for reference, as mentioned above, I'm always open for feedbacks that I can learn from and write better code in the future.
I'm going to extend the project very soon with a few tests for further practice and experimenting.
